Locational Analysis of Customer Data
The purpose of the project is to work with customer data taken from liability waivers at my axe throwing business. We have teamed up with a marketing firm in order to grow our customer base. For the marketing firm to allocate capital effectively, they need to better understand where the majority of our customers are coming from. 

I used Jupyter Notebook to develop a notebook where I can showcase the data exploration, cleaning, processing, and analysis. After removing out of state customers and other irrelevant entries, I took 16,000+ unique entries down to 14,000. Our location can be a destination. However eighty-four percent of our customers come from just twenty one of the one hundred and sixty nine towns in Connecticut.

Next I built multiple different visualizations on Tableau and built a report explaning to my stake holders some further background on my processes and then communicated my findings.
